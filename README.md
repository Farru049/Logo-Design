# Responsive Form with Gradient Background

![Project Preview](./image.png) <!-- Make sure to replace 'image.png' with the actual image file name if you upload it to your repository -->

This project is a simple yet responsive web page that centers a form in the middle of the screen, with a gradient background and a minimalistic design. The form includes an email input field and a button, which are styled to look modern and user-friendly.

## Features

- Full-height, centered content layout.
- Gradient background with a smooth transition between two colors.
- Minimalistic design with rounded corners and hover effects on the button.
- Responsive form that adjusts to different screen sizes.
- Modern web standards: Flexbox for layout and smooth hover transitions.

## Project Structure

```bash
├── index.html
├── style.css
├── image.png   # Image for the README or logo in the webpage
└── README.md   # Documentation file
```

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Used for structuring the content of the webpage.
- **CSS3**: Used for styling, including Flexbox for centering content and gradient backgrounds.

## How It Works

- The entire web page uses **Flexbox** to ensure the content is vertically and horizontally centered in the viewport, regardless of screen size.
- The `body` element has a gradient background that smoothly transitions from a light blue to a darker purple.
- The **container** and **content** divs are used to center the form on the page, with the form itself styled with padding, rounded corners, and a translucent background.
- The button has hover effects, including a color change and an increased shadow effect, making it more interactive.

## Customization

You can easily customize the design by modifying the CSS:

- To change the **gradient background**, adjust the colors in the `background` property of the `body` in the CSS.
- You can change the **form style** by modifying the `.content`, `input[type='email']`, and `button` styles in the CSS.
- The **font-family** can be adjusted in the `html, body` section to match your branding or design preferences.
